    "# Vision Module Diagnosis: The \"Black and White\" Problem\n",
    " \n",
    "## 1. The Problem\n",
    " You observed that the vision module output was patchy, noisy, or completely missing parts of the object.\n",
    " The image looked like a \"broken\" black and white mask.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why this happens\n",
    " The issue is **Global Thresholding** vs. **Uneven Lighting**.\n",
    " \n",
    " * **How Computers See:** Computers see images as a grid of numbers (0=Black, 255=White).\n",
    " * **The Old Method (Global):** It picks ONE number (e.g., 127). \"If pixel > 127, make it white. Else, black.\"\n",
    " * **The Reality:** In real life, shadows exist. A white object in a shadow might have a brightness of 100. A dark background in bright sunlight might have a brightness of 150.\n",
    " * **The Failure:** The Global Threshold separates them wrong because the *light* changed, not the *object*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. The Solution\n",
    "We use **Adaptive Thresholding**. Instead of one global number, the algorithm calculates a threshold for *every single pixel* based on its neighbors. It asks: \"Is this pixel brighter than the pixels immediately around it?\"\n"
