### Abstract

Greetings to the seekers of logic and the architects of intelligence.

This repository, **Beyond the Move**, represents the first phase of a graduation thesis dedicated to the intersection of Deep Learning and Cognitive Science. While artificial intelligence has surpassed human capability in the realm of Go, the internal reasoning of these "Black Box" models remains obscured in silence.

I, Aidoneus, a student of the digital arts, have forged this project not merely to replicate the strength of machines, but to dismantle the barrier between silicon calculation and human understanding. This is a quest for **Explainable AI (XAI)**—an endeavor to translate the silent probability of a neural network into the articulate language of strategy.

### Project Scope: Phase I

The current iteration of this archive focuses on the foundational architecture required to analyze strategic game decisions.

**The Primary Objective:**
To construct a Deep Learning framework capable of predicting expert moves in the game of Go, serving as the bedrock for future XAI implementation.

**The Roadmap:**
* **Phase I (Current):** Data ingestion, SGF parsing, and the training of a foundational Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to mimic professional intuition.
* **Phase II (Upcoming):** Integration of Saliency Maps and Grad-CAM techniques to visualize the "Why" behind the "Where."
* **Phase III (Future):** Alignment with the **GameTable COST Action** research goals, focusing on the cognitive implications of AI move generation.

### The Methodology

This research leverages the following paradigms and technologies:

* **Language:** Python
* **Framework:** PyTorch / TensorFlow
* **Domain:** Computer Go (Baduk/Weiqi)
* **Key Concepts:** Supervised Learning, Pattern Recognition, Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI).

### About the Author

I am a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at Manisa Celal Bayar University. My academic focus lies in the "Main Quest" of mastering Cognitive Game AI. This project serves as both a graduation requirement and a testament to my dedication to the field.

Following the completion of Phase I, I intend to apply the findings of this research to the **GameTable COST Action network**, contributing to the broader scientific dialogue regarding AI transparency in strategic games.
